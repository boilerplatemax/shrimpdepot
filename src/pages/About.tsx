          Shrimp Depot started the way most good hobbies do — with one tank, a handful of
          shrimp, and way too many late-night YouTube videos about water parameters.

          We specialize in <strong>Bloody Mary Neocaridina shrimp</strong> — a striking,
          deep-red variety that's hardy, beginner-friendly, and endlessly fun to watch.
          Over time, we've selectively bred our colony for intense color, strong genetics,
          and overall health.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't a big commercial farm. It's a small home operation run with genuine
          care. Every shrimp we ship is hand-selected from tanks we maintain ourselves.
          We believe in quality over quantity — smaller batches, healthier animals, happier
          customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're starting your first colony or adding to an existing one, we want
          your shrimp to arrive healthy and thrive in your tank. That's why every order
          includes a quick-start care guide and our live arrival guarantee.
        </p>
